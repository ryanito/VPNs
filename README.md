# VPN & datacenter IPs

This is a list of common VPN providers. There are lots of lists of open proxies and tor nodes on the web, but surprisingly few usable ones dedicated to VPN providers and datacenters. This list combines:

- Known VPN netblocks
- ASNs owned by datacenters and VPN providers

This list doesn't list _all_ VPNs, but should list the vast majority of common ones. [This list was inspired by ejrv manually curated VPNs list](https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs).
